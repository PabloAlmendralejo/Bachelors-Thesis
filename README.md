# Bachelor’s Theses (Mathematics & Statistics)

This repository contains my two Bachelor’s theses in **Mathematics** and **Statistics**.

- 📘 **Mathematics Thesis**: Focused on theoretical and numerical aspects of differential equations and dynamical systems.  
- 📊 **Statistics Thesis**: Focused on **Functional Data Analysis (FDA)**, including both theoretical foundations and applications to financial time series (European bond returns and IBEX35 index).

Both projects were developed as part of my undergraduate studies and include the full written reports and supporting code where applicable.
